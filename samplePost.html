    <div class="container">
        <div class="rows">
            <p class="p1">Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single
                sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually
                meet, in which there is
                no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The
                airman's
                earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.</p>

            <p class="p1">Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's
                no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.</p>
            <p class="p1">What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but
                that they set eye on the
                earth.</p>
            <p class="p1">A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become
                her protectors rather
                than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and
                cherish her.</p>
            <p class="p1">For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more
                who will, the
                experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more
                valuable than
                those which divide us.</p>
            <h2>The Final Frontier</h2>
            <p class="p1">There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and
                literally, it is a
                task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of
                just
                beginning.</p>

                just
                beginning.</p>
            <p class="p1" style="font-style: italic; color: #6c757d">The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and
                the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered
                prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</p>
            <p class="p1">Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It
                is a historical
                process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>
            <h2>Reaching for the Stars</h2>
            <p class="p1">As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to
                the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so
                fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this
                has to change a man.</p>

            <span>To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.</span>
            <p class="p1">Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to
                explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.
            </p>
            <p class="p1">As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth
                to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
